ABSTRACT:
In order to explore challenging environments like the lunar or Martian surfaces, the capability to remotely retrieve rock and mineral samples is crucial. This collaborative project focused on constructing a prototype interplanetary rover with two main objectives: developing a robust omnidirectional locomotion system adaptable to various terrains, and designing a mechanism for sample retrieval. The rover was built using four DC motors and mecanum wheels, allowing seamless movement in all directions. Motor control was facilitated by two TB6612FNG motor drivers, while a three-servo mechanical arm enabled efficient sample collection from the surface. Power was supplied through four AA batteries for the motors and an additional 9-volt battery for the ESP32. The team utilized the ESP32's standalone server function to program a website accessible via client devices without internet, providing control over the mechanical arm using three sliders. Meanwhile, motor control employed ESP-NOW, a wireless communication protocol for two or more ESP32 units. The project involved assembling the rover with an integrated mechanical arm, incorporating a joystick interface for navigation, and implementing software for seamless operation. Throughout the process, the project underscored collaborative teamwork, adept problem-solving, and clear communication. Ultimately, this robotics internship showcased the successful construction of a simulated interplanetary rover, capable of maneuvering through diverse terrains and featuring an operative mechanical arm for sample collection. This accomplishment underscores the team's coordinated endeavors in prototyping intricate space exploration functions. Nonetheless, it's important to acknowledge that the mock rover's performance and challenges faced in this controlled setting may differ from actual extraterrestrial conditions.
